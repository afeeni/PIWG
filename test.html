Z – What if I don’t have any answers for you, I’m not a therapist or a counselor <br>
A – I know but when you shared with my friend that God loved her she lit up like a light….<br>
Z – That’s because she believed that He does love her. I think she just needed to be reminded..<br>
Z – Do you know if your friend knows God?<br>
A – I’m not sure, but I think so<br>
Z – I told you also that God loves you. Do you believe that He loves you?<br>
A – Not sure, <br>
Z – We have been talking for a while do you think that I care about you?<br>
A – Yes<br>

A – No, I want you to explain it to me first ….<br>
Z – How do I explain to you what has changed my entire life, given me hope and have freed me from all my doubts and fears. How do I explain to you what has ripped out the old way of thinking and replaced it with something new … prayer, love, joy, and peace. How I can now say, not my will thy will be done…How I can now look and see a future prepared just for me. How now I can pray about a thing/situation/circumstances/ups and downs and know without a doubt that my prayers will be answered and that everything is and shall work out for MY Good. And as I am reading the Word it ministers to my broken places, my hurt places, and it heals areas of my life that I don’t even want to confront sometimes… Salvation has given a NEW Life.. A life that I could have never found on my own. A path only that could found in Salvation…. I now know why I was created, why God bought me into the world….and why I had to go through what I went through …<br> 
A – Can we pray now?<br>
Z – But, I have not explained Salvation to you<br>
A – Yes, you have….I can feel what you are saying about God, I can feel the Love and assurance that you have about the God’s Word and your life…<br>
Z – Peace have entered between us…<br>
Z – Father in Jesus name A is interested in knowing you she/he would like for you to accept her/him and bless her/him with Salvation<br>
Z – A, I am getting ready to pray for you, your life is getting ready to change mentally, physically, and will be  introduced to spirituality ….<br>
Z – I’m going to lead you into prayer an as I pray repeat after me okay..<br>
A – Okay.<br>
Z – Father we come together in Jesus Name approaching your throne of Grace and Mercy, asking that you for give me of my sins. I know you died on the cross for me and I know all that you have done you have done it for me. Please come into my life, forgive me of my sins and have your way. In Jesus Name I pray Amen.<br> 
She’s Still bowed down – <br>
Z – I’m wondering if she’s waiting to hear or feel God….<br>
