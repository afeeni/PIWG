                            <br>
19 There was a certain rich man, which was clothed in purple and fine linen, and fared sumptuously every day:
<br>
20 And there was a certain beggar named Lazarus, which was laid at his gate, full of sores,
<br>
21 And desiring to be fed with the crumbs which fell from the rich man's table: moreover the dogs came and licked his sores.
<br>
22 And it came to pass, that the beggar died, and was carried by the angels into Abraham's bosom: the rich man also died, and was buried;
<br>
23 And in hell he lift up his eyes, being in torments, and seeth Abraham afar off, and Lazarus in his bosom.
<br>
24 And he cried and said, Father Abraham, have mercy on me, and send Lazarus, that he may dip the tip of his finger in water, and cool my tongue; for I am tormented in this flame.
<br>
25 But Abraham said, Son, remember that thou in thy lifetime received thy good things, and likewise Lazarus evil things: but now he is comforted, and thou art tormented.
<br>
26 And beside all this, between us and you there is a great gulf fixed: so that they which would pass from hence to you cannot; neither can they pass to us, that would come from thence.
<br>
27 Then he said, I pray thee therefore, father, that thou wouldest send him to my father's house:
<br>
28 For I have five brethren; that he may testify unto them, lest they also come into this place of torment.
<br>
29 Abraham saith unto him, They have Moses and the prophets; let them hear them.
<br>
30 And he said, Nay, father Abraham: but if one went unto them from the dead, they will repent.
<br>
31 And he said unto him, If they hear not Moses and the prophets, neither will they be persuaded, though one rose from the dead

                            Based on our neighborhoods, communities, cities, states, country, and the world today; not from history but today definitely proclaims there's a Hell. The terrible acts carried out by the devil through people prove there is hell here on earth and a hell to go to for eternity. You believe there is a Heaven and a living God; don’t be foolish and think there’s no devil. That’s what he wants you to think, so that he can continue to infuse your mind and control your flesh. 
<br>
                            Side note: when I say your flesh, I’m talking about the will of the mind that lead you to act out in your flesh. It’s not always about (sex) when you mention the flesh.
                            </p>

                        <p style="font-size: 20px" >
                           There is a hell and people do go there. And, as long as Satan can persuade you that hell doesn’t exist he’ll continue to lead you in the foolishness of life. As, you miss the joy of living a Godly Life; nothing can compare to it. Satan’s agenda: <br/>
That you don’t confess Salvation<br/>
That you miss the love of God<br/>
The Kingdom of God - never to be built.<br/>
That you love the pleasure of sin...never to part until your death. <br/>
I think you get the meaning……<br/>

His job is to manipulate you until you get to hell; where he know longer have to play (mind games) with you anymore. He’ll just watch you be tormented through eternity.
<br/><br/>
You see if you never come to Christ and you go to hell...It was never no sweat off satan back,  it's just who he is..there’s no reward for him on how many people he can get to go to hell..it’s just what he does.

Z – What if I don’t have any answers for you, I’m not a therapist or a counselor <br>
A – I know but when you shared with my friend that God loved her she lit up like a light….<br>
Z – That’s because she believed that He does love her. I think she just needed to be reminded..<br>
Z – Do you know if your friend knows God?<br>
A – I’m not sure, but I think so<br>
Z – I told you also that God loves you. Do you believe that He loves you?<br>
A – Not sure, <br>
Z – We have been talking for a while do you think that I care about you?<br>
A – Yes<br>
Z – That’s the love of God in me-to love people I don’t know; it comes with Salvation<br>
A – Explain Salvation to me<br>
Z – Do you want to pray now for Salvation?<br>
