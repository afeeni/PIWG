<h6>The Cry of Our Nation</h6>
<p><strong>Bring Jesus to Me </strong>is the Cry of Our Nation the groanings of a lost and hurting world. A world that’s immersed in the crafting of darkness controlled by satan; whose only freedom is at the hand of the Believer who is willing to obey and Go. This statement is like an insightful revelation waiting to be discovered by a believer. Nevertheless, we have forgotten our day of redemption that we have been set apart to Go. Acts 1:8 states, but ye shall receive power after that the Holy Ghost is come upon you and ye shall be witnesses in Jerusalem, and in all Judaea, and Samaria and unto the uttermost part of the earth. However, we have failed to perceive the meaning of Go. The power is in the understanding to Go, and its wisdom is in what we do and how we go about it.  
 <br /><br />
        James 1:5 If any of you lack wisdom, let him ask of God, that giveth to all men liberally, and upbraideth not; and it shall be given him.
        <br /> <br />       
        Upbraideth means - (without finding fault in you) - nothing you have done or is doing can stop you from asking and receiving wisdom from God. There’s No Judgement! 
        <br /> <br />     
        Proverbs 11:30 KJV - The fruit of the Righteous (you)  is a tree of life; and he that winneth souls is wise. 
        <br /> <br />
        Note: The knowledge you obtain from God is LIFE.  You have the opportunity to impart seeds that will grow to produce more people who love Jesus Christ. 
        <br /> <br />
        Prayer - Father please make the atmosphere conducive for hearing so that understanding my be received and applied to the life of this reader. In Jesus Name I pray, Amen.
        <br /> <br />
        The understanding must be captured in our hearts for the love of a Soul; The Cry of a Nation shall be answered. Salvation-Healing will come but don’t let it be said of you...that you did not have time, I don’t know what to do, or that’s not my calling. But, (IF) you are a Believer of Jesus Christ, it’s your calling. 
        <br /> <br />
        There is a powerful exchange that occurs between two people as death and life breathes the same air simultaneously just for a moment. In order to separate a life from hell into heaven and to bring the kingdom of God to the lost soul. 
        <br /> <br />
        How ironic for God to place this experience at a converting moment that has been set aside for you the believer to experience. This moment is yours, the living presence of the Lord that shall be with you the rest of your life; evangelizing a soul to life for Jesus Christ. 
        <br /> <br /> 
        Statement  - usually right after the prayer of Salvation a person is so excited to share coming to christ; as their testimony is most potent to spark a fire in someone else. 
        <br /> <br />
        The call to heal a nation is within you the Believer, we are the catalyst to bring the Gospel to a sinking world. And, we do it by focusing on Kingdom Building. Bring Jesus to me…!
        <br /> <br />
        Prayer: Father here am I send me. Lead me into the path of righteousness for your work sake. Engulf my heart for the love of others that your kingdom may be built; connect me with like minded Believers who are willing to Go. In Jesus Name I ask, Amen. 
        </p>

<h6> (Exodus 2:24-25) </h6>
<p>24 And God heard their groaning, and God remembered his covenant with Abraham, with Isaac, and with Jacob.
        25 And God looked upon the children of Israel, and God had respect unto them
        <br /> <br />
        Genesis 17:7  - And I will establish my covenant between me and thee and thy seed after thee in their generations for an everlasting covenant, to be a God unto thee, and to thy seed after thee.
        <br /><br />
        Acts 2:39 - For the promise is unto you, and to your children, and to all that are afar off, even as many as the Lord our God shall call.
        <br /><br />
        Galatians 3:29 - And if you are Christ’s, then you are Abraham’s seed, and heirs according to the promise.
        <br /><br />
        Psalm 105:8 He remembers His covenant forever, The word which He commanded, for a thousand generations,
        <br /><br />
        Covenant - is a promise is an assurance that one will do a particular thing or a particular thing will happen. (A covenant with God can never be broken)
        These words proclaim to us and for us that God the Father (past/present/future) heard our cry before we came to Jesus Christ; He has prepared the way because He’s that kind of Savior. This is Christ keeping His Covenant - 
        <br /><br />
        Ephesians 4:11- 13 which is known for the Five Fold Ministry. 
        <br />
        11 And he gave some apostles; and some prophets; and some evangelists; and some, pastors and teachers;
        <br />
        12 For the perfecting of the saints, for the work of the ministry, for the edifying of the body of Christ:
        <br />
        13 Till we all come in the unity of the faith, and of the knowledge of the Son of God, unto a perfect man, unto the measure of the stature of the fulness of Christ:
        <br /><br />
        These scriptures is to bring your awareness to the fact that God heard the cry of a nation as He formed a covenant with Abraham that (we the people Abraham’s seed would be taken care of by Jesus Christ).
        <br />
        The message below speaks of the illness that stills the church from a lack of wisdom and understanding of the concept of Go! Which also, is the answer to the groaning of the people; as the promise answer. 9/18/19 Christ is using us the ones that fill the church on Sundays those that prayed and accepted Him as their Personal Savior. He works through the heart that said save me (simultaneously saying) you can use me.   
        <br /><br />
        Isaiah 55:8 “For My thoughts are not your thoughts, Nor are your ways My ways,” says the LORD.
        <br /><br />
        We are born (to sin) or (born into sin) either way we are not born of righteousness. Every human person born grows in sin because we are born with a sinful nature; we can connect and we do connect with the paralyzing mind controlling darkness satan unleashes to the world. But, Jesus Christ makes His life available to us by allowing us to pass through Him into a marvelous light of Salvation. Which changes us as to being - now in the world but not of the world any longer...So we are equipped to be used to witness to tell the story to rescue others. 
        <br /><br />
        Salvation is the key element to evangelizing a soul. But, with the lack of evangelizing a soul to discipleship, the Nation continues to grow and more people are born into families, churches, communities and the world with a 99% to grow-up a child of satan. Because we fail to do our part to evangelize a soul that could reach a family, a church, a community, and even the world. 
        <br /><br />
        But, how does (a) believer come to this knowledge to Go, we don’t fully understand at Salvation one must be taught by example. And, with the lack of no examples and no evangelizing to reaching those who are lost...we continue to keep our Nation in a state of despair, that the groanings turns into the a loss of hope; hopelessness with no thought of _____________________. 
        <br /><br />
        We want the healing but we don’t want to go through Jesus Christ to be saved, healed and changed. We want to try all types of religions, spiritual rituals and join and form groups of thought and opinions that sound convincing that seem right at that moment (for you) because it fits ___________
        <br /><br />
        We receive the Calling of God and have every culture-tongue built church on every corner throughout the world, basically we are without excuse .. 
        <br /><br />
        With that said, there's practically a church on every corner …… estimating 300 - 500 attending each church. ( check data ) If the church is in the likeness of a corner-store church, a home church it still has over 5 to 10 people. But, if the church is known to be a megachurch with 1000 constituents in any case we are in a position to be taught based on the Five Fold Ministry for kingdom building…meaning we have the believers..
        <br /><br />
        That promise Christ made with Abraham to rescue the people - is the call at Salvation when you come to Him to spread the gospel; and when you are elevated by Christ to become a Five Fold Ministry Lead...it’s just Him setting order in His way.  
        <br /><br />
        Bring Jesus to Me is the Cry of our Nation is the groaning of a lost and hurting world; that’s in desperate need of a Revival. A revival for the believer to bring to remembrance why Chrisitianity was birthed into the hearts and minds of God’s people; with the primary focus of Salvation & Evangelizing. We as believers have forgotten our day of redemption, we have forgotten that Salvation isn’t just for us; how we were with understanding came to Jesus Christ to share the Gospel that rescued us. It’s stated in Acts 1:8, But ye shall receive power, (comprehensive power) after that the Holy Ghost is come upon you: and ye shall be witnesses unto me both in Jerusalem, and in all Judaea, and in Samaria, and unto the uttermost part of the earth.
        <br /> <br />
        This is the same power that transcend your mind to believe (with the understanding that Christ gave His life that you would not have to pay for the sins  of you life) 
        <br /> <br />
        Comprehensive Power - all inclusive /complete / understanding to receive the ability to accept Jesus Christ…
        Capable - able to achieve 
        Knowledge Power -  authority ability potential competence  
        <br /> <br />
        Aramaic English Bible - Acts 1:8 “But when The Spirit of Holiness will come upon you, you shall receive power. You shall be witnesses to me in Jerusalem and in all Judea, and also among the Samaritans, and unto the borders of The Earth.”
        <br /> <br />
        Amplified - But you will receive power-authority and ability when the Holy Spirit comes upon you; and you will be My witnesses [to tell people about Me] both in Jerusalem and in all Judea, and Samaria, and even to the ends of the earth.”
        <br /> <br /> 
         
        But, along the way of life we have put God’s Cause aside and have focused on everything worldly; notwithstanding, with that knowing it’s not so easy to follow the things of Christ naturally. But, he (has) said that if we seek ye first the Kingdom of God everything (that we need) will be added unto us to do His Will Matthew 6:33. He also stipulates in Matthew 16:19 -  And I will give unto thee the keys of the kingdom of heaven: and whatsoever thou shalt bind on earth shall be bound in heaven: and whatsoever thou shalt loose on earth shall be loosed in heaven. Meaning, I give you the authority/control/understanding -  to go in my name, to speak in my name, to pray in my name, to evangelize in my name to assure you the proper tools for Kingdom Building. Also, in Ephesians 5:16 states, that for us to make the most of our time...to do his will, because these are evil days. Meaning, seize the opportunity to work my Cause; because you don’t know what you are up against.  
        <br /> <br />
        Seize the time to share God’s love. It’s the same power that changed you that can deliver and change a Nation; by its actions it is hurting, it’s slumped over in agony. 
        Love has a magnificent, undeniable, penetrating effect in giving it and receiving it. If we only would follow the Cause of the Lord we would see love change a Nation. If we would take Matthew 16:19 and work in the power of the spirit of Evangelizing we could reach 100,000, 00 souls by 2021. It’s just a number, it’s just a goal, it’s just a plan, that can be made a reality. We just need to make ourselves ready and the impossible is in God’s Hand!
        <br /> <br />
        Love changing a Nation is sharing the Word that you study to Save a Soul.
        <br /> <br />
        It doesn’t matter if you came to Christ in a church, or someone approached you and shared the gospel with you. The responsibility is on you and no one else to seek out the duties of Building the Kingdom. We have dropped the ball and have fallen away. 
        <br /> <br />
        Building up the Kingdom is healing the groaning of the land; as is part of your job description as a born again Believer. So, Others may be redeemed from the grip of Satan to take up their Cross to work the Ministry of Kingdom Building.  
        <br /> <br />
        Side-note: if you have confessed Jesus Christ and you are still living mentally the same way you did before confession, guess what, you are so loved by God.

        Luke 10:19 Behold, I give unto you power to tread on serpents and scorpions, and over all the power of the enemy: and nothing shall by any means hurt you. This is to the Believer (power over the enemy of fear/rejection/opinions/doubt is yours to do the work of the evangelist.) 
        KJV 2 Timothy 4:5 But watch thou in all things, endure afflictions, do the work of an evangelist, make full proof of thy ministry.
        NASB  2Timothy 4:5 But you, be sober (clear-minded) in all things, endure hardship, do the work of an evangelist, fulfill your ministry
