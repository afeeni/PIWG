So He sent His Son Jesus Christ to die on the cross for our sins to separate us from Satan. To distinguish us from other’s for others. But, to receive this BLESSING, we must first acknowledge who Jesus Christ is, admit you are a sinner, ask him to come into your life and understand that He died on the cross for you. </p>
                        <p style="font-size: 15px" >
                            We were born to be saved and given eternal life with the Father - this kind of love is unexplainable.We can know this kind of love - of Christ dying on the cross to save us and give us eternal life - by accepting Jesus Christ as our PERSONAL SAVIOR, the only One who can save us from going to hell. Without SALVATION, we go to hell as punishment for the wrong we continued to do since we were born. We are made right with God by placing our faith in Jesus Christ. And this is true for everyone who believes, no matter who we are.

                            The leading scripture is John 15:16 that states – you have not chosen me but I have chosen you…so, it’s a BLESSING when you are seeking Him, thinking of Him, reading about Him, hearing about Him, and wanting to know Him; it’s Him (seeking you)…..

                            Because Satan is who he is…you will pay him for the cost of the sin-actions you do; it’s like (sin belongs only to him) and when you operate in it, choose it, stay in it and enjoy it (Hebrews 11:25) you are taking something from him….so the cost (loss and damage) is a deeper torment of braking you down and not accepting Jesus Christ…

Satan’s plan offers you the satisfying of your flesh, your will, your desires, selfishness, self- centered making life all about YOU!  
 Job 2:2 And the LORD said to Satan, "Where have you come from?" Satan answered the LORD, "From roaming throughout the earth, going back and forth on it."
Creating ways to keep salvation from your children….; making it difficult for them to choose and except and obey you…

                        <strong style="font-size: 15px; color:white;">Sin Is: Not Accepting Jesus Christ as your Personal Savior </strong><br>
                           <p style="font-size: 20px; color:white;"> It is a separation from God – it is a torment that robs you of your future and it causes you to pass bad behavior to your family and set unpleasant examples ….sin when not confessed causes an illness that could last your life-time. Unconfessed sin also carries assigned dysfunctions (that will destroy) one thing will always lead to another wrong thing. It is never going to turn into a right thing until it is identified and confessed to Jesus Christ. 
Sin actions are pleasurable for a season (Hebrews 11:25) – it’s either time to die or to be spiraled out of control. Sin causes you to miss so much out of life…moments of peace/joy that permeates in situations, circumstances and during your ups and downs…you miss those God and Jesus moments that will carry you – through…it blocks victories that have been assigned to you…sin will follow/lead you into dimensions unsuited for you. It causes the mind of your heart to believe a lie – 
it makes an untruth for itself to continue to control all the unconfessed sin (held captive) in your soul. Sin also causes you to miss the presences of the Lord and to know the joy of an answered prayer – which you’ve prayed! And, as sweet as Worshiping God you miss an experience that you would want to share with everyone you meet.

                            The only one who should carry such garbage and decay is Satan himself – because it belongs to him
Proverbs 26:11 – as a dog returns to its vomit, so fools repeat their folly……
Sin it germinates itself as it reproduces itself within you – you create your own vicious cycle: you can’t shake it – it is the confession
of being a sinner and excepting Jesus Christ as your Personal Savior. Salvation goes to the Root to kill what affects you from coming to 
Him…it is the confession that heals the areas you have been carrying for so long …Root Kill – The Blood of Jesus
I Timothy 1:15 - This is a faithful saying, and worthy of all acceptation, that Christ Jesus came into the world to save sinners; of whom 
I am chief.
Eph. 3:7 whereof I was made a minister, according to the gift of the grace of God given unto me by the effectual working of his power.
(I Tawana Moore, no longer carry the weight of my sin and the world’s mess. I have accepted Jesus Christ as my personal Savior, I have 
confessed that I was a sinner and all my acts were against the Lord, I now believe in Him and I trust Him). 
John 15:19 - If ye were of the world, the world would love his own: but because ye are not of the world, but I have chosen you out of the 
world, therefore the world hateth you. 

It is the experience of salvation and the knowledge that allows us to taste and see that God is good. (Psalm 34:8)  But, we can know this kind 
of love – of Jesus Christ dying on the Cross to save us and giving us eternal life and that’s accepting Him as our PERSONAL SAVIOR. The only 
person who can save us from this world and from going to Hell – where Satan’s dwelling place is - God the Father, Jesus Christ the Son and the 
Holy Spirit. 
I think for us to understand the power and the wisdom to except Salvation – we must first know, what we are being saved from? Why get saved? Why should I be set free from Satan? The answers are listed below:  (review)

                                The Bible says that Satan was created by God as a cherub, the most powerful of God's angelic beings. Sometime after his creation and before the creation of mankind, Satan rebelled against God and took one third of the angels (now referred to as demons) with him into rebellion (into the earth)
Satan’s rebellion became his character – telling people lies, stirring up hatred, sexual immorality, impurity, debauchery, idolatry, witchcraft, discord, jealousy, fits of rage, selfish ambition, envy, drunkenness, orgies, enslavement to sin 
Job 2:2 And the LORD said to Satan, "Where have you come from?" Satan answered the LORD, "From roaming throughout the earth, going back and forth on it."

Where did he come from? Satan came from God in Heaven – he was one of God’s angels in the position of great authority ….
Why is he evil? Because of Rebellion - revolting against righteousness, authority, turns away from the right thing to do which is the normal thing to do…not in its nature to do so, disgusted with love, obeying, and seeks harm not peace and enjoys our displeasures… causes disasters in families, communities, cities, and in love, in children, and even in the world that he’s prince of… 
Rebellion – is the character of Satan, it binds you to the untruth and it forms a hardened heart, and keeps you from even wanting to know anything about truth.
 It only seeks to please what is wrong/negative/hateful/unhappy/disrespectful/depressing and everything that can opposes Jesus Christ.  It loves pleasing the flesh and not the spirit, and as long as he can fill you with rebellious thoughts and acts of satisfying self….he wins every time…this is why it is important to hear the Word of God -  it’s the ONLY thing in earth that can deliver us from the enemy…that can keep us out of Satan’s dwelling place, bring us out of darkness…Luke 11:28 Blessed are those that hear the Word and obey it…
Why does he have the power he has? God is not a God who should lie or will lie. He gave him the authority and power in the position that he was in - in heaven as an angel… the same free will we have they have also.. Too choose love or rebellion….Satan choose rebellion… so he was removed without having his power revoked as he was kicked out of heaven into the earth….
Note: Eternal is everlasting, never-ending, with God or with Satan (You Choose)
